# ProjectSprings

This project involved various tasks such as understanding, studying, designing, developing, testing, and analyzing.
We implemented classes for binary conversion and Fourier analysis based on the knowledge gained from lectures and reading relevant literature. The classes were designed to perform specific functions like simulating springs, computing Fourier transforms, and converting binary numbers. We tested the implemented classes to ensure they worked correctly and without errors. Overall, the project covered a wide range of activities to successfully implement and test the functionalities related to mechanical conversion, Fourier analysis, etc.
