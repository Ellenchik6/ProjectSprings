# ProjectBilliards
In this project we have implemented simulations of various billiard models using Java.
We started with a horizontal circular billiard and calculated the particle's position, momentum, and reflections using physics equations. Then we extended the simulation to include a vertical circular billiard and a horizontal stadium billiard. We observed the behavior of the particles and tested the reversibility of their motion, and examined the stadium billiard as a pseudo-random number generator.
Overall, this project provided a practical application of mathematics, mechanics principles, numerical algorithms, etc.


# ProjectSprings
This project involved various tasks such as understanding, studying, designing, developing, testing, and analyzing.
We implemented classes for binary conversion and Fourier analysis based on the knowledge gained from lectures and reading relevant literature. The classes were designed to perform specific functions like simulating springs, computing Fourier transforms, and converting binary numbers. We tested the implemented classes to ensure they worked correctly and without errors. Overall, the project covered a wide range of activities to successfully implement and test the functionalities related to mechanical conversion, Fourier analysis, etc.
